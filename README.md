# Datasets

This is a collection of test datasets used in our lab. 

They are categorized into DNA and Protein test datasets.

Each file is in [PHYLIP](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/PHYLIP_multiple_alignment_format)  format and named by the number of taxa.

Each PHYLIP file comes with a corresponding .info file describing the file and an optional .part [RAxML](https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML)-style partition file.
For a description of the partition file format see the RAxML [manual](http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/php/countManualNew.php).
For most files a generated [maximum parsimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_parsimony_%28phylogenetics%29) tree is also provided.
